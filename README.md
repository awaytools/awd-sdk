awd-sdk
=======

At the moment, the libawd is under heavy work in progress.

The master branch works with the AwayExtension3dsmax.

The dev branch is the refactored awd-sdk, that works with AwayExtensionsFlashPro.

Once AwayExtensions have been updated to work with the dev-branch of libawd, the dev can be merged into the master.
